Discord-Message Mirro
===

This is a remake of my first ever Discord bot. Back in days when announcement channels were not a thing I made this for announcements on our servers. 

How to use
===

I will give a checkboard here since I don't have time for this part.

1. Put token into .env
2. Put your user id into config.json's leadMaintainer Array.
3. Add the bot.
4. Use setfeed for first setup.
5. Then add following channels.
